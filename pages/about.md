At Refinitiv, I am a customer success manager responsible for our strategic relationships in the oil and gas industry. In addition to my work at Refinitiv, I am the organizer of [Effective Altruism Houston](https://www.meetup.com/Effective-Altruists-Houston/) where I aim to inspire others to be more effective in their giving and in their careers.

The purpose of this website is to test my knowledge and put it out there for you to judge. Connect with me on Twitter [here](http://twitter.com/brad_johansen).
